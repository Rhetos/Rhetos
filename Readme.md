# Rhetos - A DSL platform

Rhetos is a DSL platform for Enterprise Application Development.

* It enables developers to create a **Domain-Specific Programming Language** and use it to write their applications.
* There are libraries available with ready-to-use implementations of many standard business and design patterns or technology integrations.

Rhetos works as a compiler that **generates the business application** from the source written in the DSL scripts.

* The generated application is a standard business applications based on Microsoft .NET technology stack.
* It is focused on the back-end development: It generates the business logic layer (C# object model), the database and the web API (REST, SOAP, etc.).
* The database is not generated from scratch on each deployment, it is upgraded instead, protecting the existing data.

Rhetos comes with the *CommonConcepts* DSL package, a programming language extension that contains many ready-to-use features for building applications.
