# Rhetos.TestCommon

This library provides **utility classes for unit testing** of applications developed on [Rhetos development platform](https://github.com/Rhetos/Rhetos).

It depends on **MSTest framework**.
It does not support **XUnit**, but most of the utilities from this library are already provided by the XUnit's Assert class.

See Rhetos framework's [Readme.md](https://github.com/Rhetos/Rhetos/blob/master/Readme.md)
and [Wiki](https://github.com/Rhetos/Rhetos/wiki) for detailed instructions on using the Rhetos platform.
