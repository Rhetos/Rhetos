# Rhetos.MSBuild

This package is a core component of [Rhetos development platform](https://github.com/Rhetos/Rhetos).

It provides MSBuild integration for Rhetos DSL.
By adding this NuGet package to a .NET project, the .NET build process is automatically extended to support:

- **Compiling Rhetos DSL scripts**.
- Executing Rhetos code generators.

See Rhetos framework's [Readme.md](https://github.com/Rhetos/Rhetos/blob/master/Readme.md)
and [Wiki](https://github.com/Rhetos/Rhetos/wiki) for detailed instructions on using the Rhetos platform.
