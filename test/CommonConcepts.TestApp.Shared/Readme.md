The integration test projects (CommonConcepts.Test*) cannot be built unless the Rhetos NuGet packages are built and placed in the `dist` folder
(this is result of `Build.bat`), and the database connection strings configured (this required manual setup).

See instructions in sections "Building the source code" and "Testing" in the root [Readme.md](../../Readme.md) file.
